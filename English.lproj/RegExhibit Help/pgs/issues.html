			<p>RegExhibit was written to explore regular expressions. It is not optimized to deal with large amounts of text. That doesn&rsquo;t mean, it cannot handle them, but you won&rsquo;t get great performance.</p>
			<p>When you resize RegExhibit&rsquo;s main window the down arrow in the scrollbar of the area that shows the results for a replacement or a split, can become unresponsive. This seems to be a Cocoa issue.</p>
			<p>If you use certain Unicode characters, e.g. Chinese, in your sample text without checking the &ldquo;Unicode&rdquo; modifier, RegExhibit will report an invalid regular expression even when this is not the case. With &ldquo;Unicode&rdquo; checked, everything should work as expected.</p>
			<p>You cannot use a null character, (<code>\0</code> or any of its variants), inside the replacement string when replacing. RegExhibit uses null characters internally, and it will think your regular expression is invalid. Sorry. On the bright side: even if you could use them, you wouldn&rsquo;t see them as replacement text, because they are non-printing characters. ;-)</p>
