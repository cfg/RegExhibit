			<p>RegExhibit is a program that allows you to interactively examine and test regular expressions. If you don&rsquo;t know what regular expressions are, chances are this application is not for you.</p>
			<h2><b>About RegExhibit</b></h2>
			<p>Although they are very useful and powerful, regular expressions can also be hard to write correctly. RegExhibit helps you by showing you whether your expression matches, what it matches and where it matches.</p>
			<p>To do this, RegExhibit uses Perl. In fact, it is nothing more than a fancy front end. That of course, means that you can use one of the most sophisticated regular expression engines in existence. On the other hand, it means that you are limited by Perl&rsquo;s repertoire. (So named captures are out for now.) </p>
			<h2>Talk to me</h2>
			<p>Please note, that RegExhibit is the first real Cocoa program that I have written. Although I have done my best, chances are there some bugs. If you find any, have some ideas on how to improve RegExhibit or just want to share some thoughts on it, <a href="mailto:roger_jolly@mac.com">I would love to hear from you</a>.</p>
